        <p>Hello! My name is Eli Avila and I am from Puebla Mexico.
            I enjoy play the guitar and write poetry ad songs.
            I am currently studying Software Development at BYU-I.
            Now I am working in a bilingual call center, to be
            honest it has helped me a lot to improve my English skills.
            I am so excited to learn how to build websites
            and build programs to help others in their different jobs.

        <p>Puebla is a state located in east-central Mexico. It borders the states of Veracruz, Oaxaca, Guerrero,
            Morelos, State of Mexico, Tlaxcala, and Hidalgo. The architecture of Puebla is mainly characterized by the
            Pueblan Baroque, a unique fusion of European and Indigenous
            styles, which is expressed through its ornamentation and the use of Talavera tiles.</p>
